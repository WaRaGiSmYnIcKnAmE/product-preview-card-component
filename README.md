### What I learned

While working, I encountered a problem on mobile devices due to the button sticking when pressed. Fixed the entire line that I checked in the manual that I often use [Doka-guide](https://doka.guide/css/hover/)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (any-hover: hover) {
    button:hover {
        background-color: hsl(157, 37%, 14%);
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

-   [Doka-guide](https://doka.guide/css/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
